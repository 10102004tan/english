"Tomâ€™s Restaurant"

Tom is a chef. He has a small restaurant in town. Every day, he cooks for his customers. But does he cook well? No, he doesnâ€™t!

A customer comes to the restaurant and asks,

"Do you have hot soup?"
Tom says,

"Yes, I do!"
But when the customer gets the soup, it is cold! He asks,

"Why is my soup cold?"
Tom smiles and says,

"Because the fridge works very well!"
Another customer asks,

"Do you have sweet cake?"
Tom says,

"Of course!"
But when the customer eats the cake, it is salty! She says,

"This is not sweet! Do you taste your food before serving?"
Tom shakes his head.

"No, I donâ€™t. I love surprises!"
The customers look at each other. Do they like the food? No, they donâ€™t! They leave the restaurant quickly.

Tom watches them go and asks,

"Why donâ€™t they finish their food? Isnâ€™t my cooking special?"
Yes, Tom. It is very specialâ€¦ but in a bad way! ðŸ˜†
